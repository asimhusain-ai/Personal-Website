        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Asim, a B.Tech student in Computer Science Engineering with a strong passion for AI, ML, and DL. Over the past few years, I’ve worked on and deployed several ML-powered web applications, combining clean, responsive design with solid technical functionality.
          I’m confident working with Python and C++ | C, and I really enjoy bringing complex algorithms to life through real-world projects. During my internships at Internshala and CETPA, I got hands-on experience with real datasets, model training, and practical tools used in the industry. These experiences helped me connect classroom theory with how things actually work in the field.
          Beyond the technical side, I’ve also built up strong soft skills like teamwork, public speaking, and leadership  which I’ve found are just as important. They help me communicate clearly, collaborate effectively, and step up when it’s time to lead.
          I’m always curious and eager to explore new technologies. For me, innovation isn’t just something I aim for, it’s a mindset I bring to every project. I love learning, building, and pushing boundaries to see what’s possible.</p>

      title: "Islam: The Eternal Path of Peace, Purpose, and Divine Light ", 
      content: "Islam, derived from the Arabic root word “S-L-M”, meaning peace, submission, and safety, is not just a religion, but a complete and timeless way of life revealed by the One True God—Allah, to guide humanity toward peace, justice, mercy, and eternal salvation.<br><br>It is the final and universal message in the divine chain of revelation that began with Prophet Adam عليه السلام, continued through Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus (peace be upon them all), and was completed through the final prophet, Muhammad ﷺ, over 1,400 years ago in the Arabian Peninsula — a message that transcends time, geography, race, and class, offering clarity to the confused, healing to the broken, and purpose to the wandering soul.<br><br>Islam is built upon five noble pillars: the Shahadah (declaration of faith), affirming that there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is His Messenger, Salah (daily prayers) performed five times a day to maintain constant connection with the Creator , Zakah (charity) to purify wealth and uplift the poor , Sawm (fasting in Ramadan) as a means of self-discipline and spiritual elevation , and Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah), a sacred journey of devotion and unity performed once in a lifetime by those who are able.<br><br>but Islam is not limited to rituals, it encompasses every aspect of life, including ethics, justice, family, economics, governance, and spirituality, rooted deeply in two primary sources: the Qur’an, the unchanged word of Allah revealed in perfect Arabic, and the Sunnah, the teachings and actions of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ.<br><br>The word “Muslim” means one who submits peacefully to the will of Allah, and the essence of Islam lies in achieving peace — within oneself, with others, with nature, and ultimately with the Creator.<br><br>Its message is simple yet profound: that Allah is One, without partner, son, or equal, that He alone is worthy of worship, and that human beings were created not in vain, but for a higher purpose — to know, love, and serve their Lord, and to live in a way that brings benefit to others.<br><br>Islam elevates the status of every human being by teaching that no one is inherently superior due to race, wealth, or lineage, for “Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you.” (Qur’an 49:13) — a powerful declaration of universal human dignity and equality.<br><br>The faith also commands justice, kindness, forgiveness, and care for the vulnerable, while forbidding oppression, arrogance, and cruelty.<br><br>Muslims believe in life after death, divine judgment, and eternal reward or punishment, recognizing that this life is a temporary test and the Hereafter is the true home.<br><br>The Qur’an, a miracle both in language and content, addresses not only spiritual matters but also science, history, law, and human psychology — a living guide that continues to inspire reflection, reform, and transformation, despite widespread misconceptions, Islam firmly condemns violence, extremism, and injustice — stating that the killing of an innocent soul is as if killing all of humanity (Qur’an 5:32), and the Prophet ﷺ declared, “The best among you are those who are best in character,” teaching that the strongest believer is one who controls his anger and uplifts others.<br><br>Over the centuries, Islam gave rise to flourishing civilizations in science, medicine, architecture, literature, and philosophy, producing scholars like Ibn Sina, Al-Khwarizmi, and Al-Ghazali, while building societies where Jews, Christians, and people of various faiths lived and worked together in peace.<br><br>Today, with over 1.9 billion followers across every continent, Islam remains the fastest-growing religion in the world, attracting seekers of truth through its clarity, beauty, and sense of purpose.<br><br>In a world often filled with confusion and moral decline, Islam continues to offer light, balance, and hope — calling every heart to return to its Creator with sincerity and submission, to be Muslim is to live with intention, to walk humbly upon the earth, to seek knowledge, serve humanity, and remember Allah in every moment.<br><br>The Qur’an proclaims: “This day I have perfected for you your religion, completed My favor upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your way.” (Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:3) — a declaration that Islam is not just a faith, but a divine gift, a mercy, and a complete way to live and succeed both in this world and the next. <br><br>Truly, Islam is the eternal path to peace, purpose, and divine light, leading all who embrace it toward harmony, justice, and the everlasting pleasure of their Creator — a message of truth for every soul, in every age, until the end of time."

      title: "The Light of Arabia: The Life and Legacy of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ", 
      content: "The life of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, the final Messenger of Allah and the most revered figure in Islam, is not just a chapter in human history, but the turning point for humanity — a divine transformation that reshaped hearts and continues to guide billions even today.<br><br>Born in 570 CE in the sacred city of Makkah, he was a descendant of Prophet Ibrahim عليه السلام through Ismail عليه السلام and belonged to the noble Quraysh tribe, specifically the Hashimite clan, known for caring for the Kaaba.Though born into honor, he faced early hardships — his father died before his birth, and his mother passed away when he was just six, leaving him an orphan raised first by his grandfather Abdul Muttalib and later by his uncle Abu Talib. Under divine care, he grew into a man renowned for truthfulness and integrity, earning the titles 'Al-Amin' (The Trustworthy) and 'As-Sadiq' (The Truthful), admired even before receiving revelation.<br><br>He lived a simple, contemplative life, staying away from idol worship and injustice, often retreating to the Cave of Hira to reflect deeply on existence and morality. At age 40, during one such retreat, the Archangel Jibreel عليه السلام came with the command “Iqra!” (Read!), marking the beginning of the final divine revelation — the Qur’an. Though initially shaken, he accepted his mission and began calling people toward Tawheed (Oneness of God), justice, compassion, and universal brotherhood, in opposition to Makkah’s corrupt elites.<br><br>He and his followers endured years of persecution, boycott, and violence, yet he remained steadfast — responding not with hate, but with patience, prayer, and mercy. In 622 CE, he migrated to Yathrib (later Madinah), where he established the first Islamic state rooted in justice, tolerance, and law, uniting Muslims, Jews, and pagans under the Constitution of Madinah. As a Prophet and statesman, he led with unmatched humility — praying at night, mending his clothes, forgiving enemies, and showing kindness to all creation. As a military leader, he upheld ethics even in war, forbidding harm to innocents, and as a family man, he showed boundless love and gentleness.<br><br>His life, preserved in Hadith and Seerah, is the most emulated in history and continues to be followed by Muslims in every aspect of life.
